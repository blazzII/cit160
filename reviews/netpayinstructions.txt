Write a program that calculates an employee's after tax pay.

The regular pay rate is constant of $15 per hour.
The overtime pay rate is constant at $22.50 per hour.
The user needs to be able to enter the total regular hours and total overtime hours worked for the period.
The tax rate is constant at 15% of the gross amount earned during the period.
Example
The user enters 40 regular hours and 2.5 hours of overtime.
The calculation of after tax pay would be regular pay (15 * 40) + overtime pay (22.50 * 2.5) - the tax amount.
The tax amount is 15% of that gross pay which is .15( 15 * 40 + 22.5 * 2.5).
600 (reg) + 56.25 (ot) - 98.44 (tax) = $557.81
